## Project Overview
RunForge is an ML orchestration platform for training,
tracking, and deploying ML models.

## Architecture
- api/ -> FastAPI backend
- workers/ -> Celery workers
- trainers/ -> model-specific training logic
- frontend/ -> React dashboard

## Commands
Start backend:
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

Start worker:
celery -A workers.celery_app worker --loglevel=info

## Rules
- Use async FastAPI endpoints where possible
- Follow strict OOP principles and keep production-grade code quality
- Keep trainer classes modular
- Do not hardcode model configs
