## Project Overview
TrainGrid is an ML orchestration platform for training,
tracking, and deploying ML models.

## Architecture
- api/ -> FastAPI backend
- workers/ -> Celery workers
- trainers/ -> model-specific training logic
- frontend/ -> React dashboard

See docs/architecture.md for the detailed project structure and layer responsibilities.

## Commands
Start backend:
uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload

Start worker:
celery -A backend.workers.celery_app worker --loglevel=info

## Rules
- Use async FastAPI endpoints where possible
- Follow strict OOP principles and keep production-grade code quality
- Keep trainer classes modular
- Do not hardcode model configs
- **Planning:** ALWAYS provide a plan and the proposed code in the chat before making any actual code changes. Do not execute code changes without prior approval.
- **Communication:** After every code change or implementation step, provide a concise explanation of WHAT was changed and WHY it was put in that specific file/directory. This is crucial for learning the architecture.
- **Command Execution:** Always run commands one by one and avoid executing multiple commands in a single step (e.g., avoid joining commands with `;` or `&&`).
- **Validation:** Before completing any task, you MUST run the project's quality checks by executing `.\check.ps1`.

## Current Status: Vertical Slice - Tabular Training
We are implementing the first "Vertical Slice" of the platform: training a `RandomForestClassifier` on tabular CSV data.

### Completed Milestones
- [x] **Architecture defined** in `docs/architecture.md`.
- [x] **RandomForest Trainer** implemented in `trainers/sklearn/`.
- [x] **Database Model** for Runs created in `infrastructure/database/models.py`.
- [x] **API Schemas** (Pydantic) defined in `api/schemas/run.py`.
- [x] **Run Service** (`api/services/run_service.py`): Logic to create runs and trigger Celery tasks.
- [x] **API Router** (`api/routers/runs.py`): Endpoints to start and track runs.
- [x] **Celery Task** (`workers/tasks/training_tasks.py`): Connects trainer and saves results to DB.
- [x] **Backend Initialization** (`api/main.py`): DB table creation and router registration.
- [x] **API Tests** (`tests/api/test_runs.py`): End-to-end tests for the `/runs` endpoints using `TestClient`.

### Immediate Next Steps
1.  **Frontend Dashboard** (`frontend/`): Scaffold the React frontend and build the tabular training run submission form.
2.  **Containerization**: Add Dockerfiles for the backend (FastAPI + Celery) and the React frontend, and create a `docker-compose.yml` that brings up Redis, the backend, a Celery worker, and a persistent SQLite volume.

## Development Workflows
- **API Changes:** Always create both a SQLAlchemy model and a Pydantic schema (Base, Create, and Response) to maintain separation of concerns.
- **Training Logic:** Keep it inside the `trainers/` directory, decoupled from the API and Workers.
- **Commits:** Use `feat:`, `fix:`, or `docs:` prefixes. Push changes after successful implementation of a component.
